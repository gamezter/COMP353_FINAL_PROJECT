NOTE
1. PatientVisit has new column called doctor, which corresponds to employeeID for the doctor that he/she met on the visit.
   I felt like it was necessary since in the assignment table, doctors AND nurses AND interns may receive the same visit, but only doctor's ID will be significant in visit table.
 
2. Login seems to be bugged. (I start as logged-in state, and can't logout and login back in, it gives me 'password' does not have binding. Did you acutally set a password now ?)

Working-ish as of this updated version.(2015-08-14)
